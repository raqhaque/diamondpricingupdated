# Predicting Diamond Prices Project 3

### Predicting Diamond Prices
This project is designed for three main reasons:

* To give you a feel for what you’ll be doing throughout the Nanodegree Program
* To introduce you to Udacity’s project submission and review process
* To make sure you feel comfortable with the basics before you begin. If it feels too easy, don't worry. We have some great stuff in store for you.
### Project Overview
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

### US Number System
All numbers that will be presented in this project  will be based on the US numbering system where 5,269 is "five thousand two hundred sixty nine" and 158.1 is "one hundred fifty eight point one" where 1 is a decimal number. This is very important so please take note of this.

### Project Details
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the company’s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.
